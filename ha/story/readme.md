Our name Hoot & Annie is inspired by the Scottish word hootenanny.

A word that became a colloquialism used by Scottish settlers in the United States to describe a party or celebration. Our theory on why they needed a special word: we think they liked to party because their whiskey making abilities started what today is known as moonshining. Enough said.

People in the early 20th-century America used the word as a placeholder for things whose names they couldn’t remember or were unknown. What, really? A word for when you have a mind blank. Brillant.

The leadership of early firefighting battalions use hootenanny to describe a meeting of the minds where important crew heads came together to focus on a particular challenge. And today, event planners use the word as a way to call together all of their organizers to accomplish a seemingly monumental task.

Our favorite part, the word still carries the meaning of celebration (sometimes with dancing) which we think is perfect.

The spirit of the name Hoot & Annie and each experience we design, we like to think of it as ¼ 
Part ingenuitive moonshining operation
Part meeting of the minds
Part informal celebration
Part not sure what to call it

The math usually adds up to result in the perfect mix of an experience filled with fun, challenge, celebration, and occassionally speechlessness.
