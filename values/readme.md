# Values

### Initial Brainstorming

- Being present among the community, not isolated from the energy of other doers
- Work will be part of daily life - and balanced as such among the other activities of a healthy life: rest, exercise, education, and play.
- We'll do what we do, until we don't. Commitment to a goal is both ultimate and temporal.
- You have the power to create change. If you see something that needs improvement -- do it.
- The question ‘How can I help?’ is a powerful one, and different than ‘Do you want some help?’ We look for ways to support the things and people we care about.
